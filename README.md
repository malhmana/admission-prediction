##This dataset includes various information like GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP (Statement of Purpose), LOR (Letter of Recommendation), CGPA, research and chance of admit. In this dataset, 400 entries are included.

### GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
### TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
### University Rating ( out of 5 )
### Statement of Purpose (SOP) and Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Strength ( out of 5 )
### Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
